<h3> Wikiflowers </h3>
	<p> A flower is a special kind of plant part. Flowers are also called the bloom or blossom of a plant. 
	The flower grows on a stalk - a thin node - which supports it. Flowers have petals. Inside the part of the flower that has petals are the parts which produce pollen and seeds. 
	Flowers are the reproductive structure of flowering plants, which are plants of the division Magnoliophyta, also called the Angiosperms. In many plants, a flower is its most colourful part.
	We say the plant 'flowers', 'is flowering' or 'is in flower' when this colourful part begins to grow bigger and open out. </p>

<h3>Evolution of flowers </h3>
	<p> Flowers are modified leaves possessed only by the flowering plants (angiosperms), which are relatively late to appear in the fossil record. 
	The earliest known fossils of flowers and flowering plants are from 130 million years ago, in the Lower Cretaceous.
	The flowering plants have long been assumed to have evolved from within the gymnosperms; but the known gymnosperms form a clade which is distinct from the angiosperms.
	It has been concluded that the two clades diverged (split) some 300 million years ago. </p>

<h3> Decoration Flowers</h3>
	<p> Flowers have long been admired and used by humans. Most people think that flowers are beautiful.
	Many people also love flowers for their fragrances (scents). People enjoy seeing flowers growing in gardens.
	People also enjoy growing flowers in their backyards, outside their homes.
	People often wear flowers on their clothes or give flowers as a gift during special occasions, holidays, or rituals, such as the birth of a new baby (or a Christening), at weddings (marriages),
	at funerals (when a person dies). People often buy flowers from businesses called florists. </p>

<h3> Edible Flowers </h3>
	<p> People also eat some types of flowers. 
	Flower vegetables include broccoli, cauliflower and artichoke. The most expensive spice, saffron, comes from the crocus flower. 
	Other flower spices are cloves and capers. Hops flowers are used to flavour beer. Dandelion can be made into wine.
	Honey is flower nectar that has been collected and processed by bees. Honey is often named for the type of flower that the bees are using (for example, clover honey).
	Some people put flowers from nasturtiums, chrysanthemums, or carnations in their food. Flowers can also be made into tea.
	Dried flowers such as chrysanthemum, rose, and jasmine are used to make tea. </p>
